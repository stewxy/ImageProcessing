# SnipMath
A program that allows users to highlight a region on their screen and solves simple math problems.  
Utilises Pytesseract OCR tool to convert images to text. The accuracy of images is improved with Image Processing techniques

## Image Processing Procedures
- Image Resizing
- Grayscale
- Dilation
- Erosion
- Binarisation

## Tech Stack
- Python

## Ideas for Future Implementations
- Improve text recognition
- Create a set of testdata by training pytesseract
- Add more equations that the program can recognise and calculate
